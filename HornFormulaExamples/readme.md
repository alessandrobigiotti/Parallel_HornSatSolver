# Horn Formule
Unfortunately we can't find the HornFormula.cnf files in the Online SAT Banchmark. We need to edit the files contained in some banchmark ([example](http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~hoos/SATLIB/benchm.html)) to make it in the form of Horn Clause.
The file in this folder was modified with "vi" editor.
